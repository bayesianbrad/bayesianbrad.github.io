The following is a condensed view of the paper [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Without Detailed Balance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5191.pdf)

# General Idea

The ideas presented in this paper increase mixing and reduce computation waste from rejected evaluations of the Leapfrog integrator. 
To do this the paper introduces an alternative solution to the fixed point equation, that would usually be resolved with detailed balance and so the Metropolis reject-accept step. 
This paper eliminates the need of this final step, which in turn reduces the random walk behaviour. 
To create this new solution it essentially requires that we perform multiple full Leapfrog integrations until we can guarantee acceptance.   

## Fixed Point Equation

$$\begin{equation}
	\int p(\mathbf{x'}) T(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{x}) d\mathbf{x} = p(\mathbf{x'})
\end{equation}$$
where $$p(\mathbf{x})$$ represents the stationary distribution and $$T(\mathbf{x'}|\mathbf{x})$$ is the transition operator. 

## Detailed Balance
The usual way to guarantee that the Markov transition distribution $$T(\mathbf{x'}|\mathbf{x})$$ satisfies the fixed point equation is to use the Metropolis update. The probability of the transition moving the state forward or backward is equal. This leads to random walk behaviour. 

## Paper Notations
### HMC Basics
* $$\mathbf{v}$$ represents the velocity, which in the paper setting is equivalent to the momentum as the mass matrix is assumed to be the identity.
* $$\mathbf{x}$$ represents positions.
* $$\zeta = \{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}\}$$ represents the state space variables.
* $$p(\zeta) = p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}) = p(\mathbf{x})p(\mathbf{v})$$

We can view all operations in HMC in terms of a sequence of operators, acting on some state $$\zeta$$. 


### Operators

The **Flip operator** $$\mathbf{F}$$ flips the direction of momentum. $$\mathbf{F}\zeta \rightarrow \{\mathbf{x}, -\mathbf{v}\}$$.

The **Leapfrog operator** $$\mathbf{L}(\epsilon, M) \equiv \mathbf{L}$$ carries out a full integration of the trajectory for a given step size $$\epsilon$$ and trajectory length $$M$$. $$\mathbf{L}\zeta = \{\mathbf{x'}, \mathbf{v'}\} = \zeta'$$.

The final operator is the **Randomization operator** $$\mathbf{R}(\beta)$$ which corrupts the momentum with an amount of noise that depends on $$\beta$$. 

## Properties of the Operators
### Flip Operator
$$\begin{align}
	\mathbf{F}\zeta \rightarrow \{\mathbf{x}, -\mathbf{v}\} \\
	\mathbf{F}^{-1}\zeta = \mathbf{F}\zeta\\
	H(\mathbf{F}\zeta) = H(\zeta)\\
	|\det(\frac{\partial \mathbf{F}\zeta}{\partial \zeta^{T}})| = 1
\end{align}$$
### Leapfrog Operator
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{L}\zeta \rightarrow \zeta' \\
\mathbf{L}^{-1}\zeta = \mathbf{F}\mathbf{L}\mathbf{F}\zeta\\
H(\mathbf{F}\zeta) = H(\zeta)\\
|\det(\frac{\partial \mathbf{L}\zeta}{\partial \zeta^{T}})| = 1
\end{align}$$
### Momentum Randomization Operator
$$\mathbf{R}(\beta)$$ mixes an amount of Gaussian noise determined by $$\beta \in [0,1]$$ into the momentum "velocity" vector.
$$\begin{align}
\mathbf{R}\zeta \rightarrow \{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v'}\} \\
\mathbf{v'} = \mathbf{v}\sqrt{1 - \beta} + \mathbf{n}\sqrt{\beta} \hspace{1cm} \mathbf{n} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbb{I})
\end{align}$$

The momentum randomization operator is no longer deterministic. When $$\beta = 1$$ implies that this is just normal HMC. The paper suggests, *heuristically*, that $$\beta = \alpha^{1 \backslash \epsilon M} $$ provides good mixing. $$\alpha = 0.2$$ in code.

## Standard HMC in Operator Notation

Let $$\zeta^{(t,s)}$$ represent the state at sampling step $$t$$ and sampling subset $$s$$. 

### Step 1a 
Generate a proposed update.
$$\begin{equation*}
\zeta' = \mathbf{FL}\zeta^{(t,0)}
\end{equation*}$$
### Step 1b 
Accept or reject proposed update. 
$$\begin{equation}
\pi_{accept} = \min(1, \frac{p(\zeta')}{p(\zeta)})
\end{equation}$$
$$\begin{equation}
\zeta^{(t,1)}  =
\begin{cases}
\zeta' &\hspace{1cm}\text{ with probability } \pi_{accept} \\
\zeta^{(t,0)} &\hspace{1cm}\text{ with probability } 1 - \pi_{accept}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

If we reject, we waste the computations used in generating the proposed state. 

### Step 2
Flip the momentum. 
$$\begin{equation}
	\zeta^{(t,2)} = \mathbf{F}\zeta^{(t,1)}
\end{equation}$$
When the state is rejected and we flip, we are essentially doubling back on ourselves and waste unnecessary computation.  
### Step 3
Corrupt the momentum with noise.

$$\begin{equation}
	\zeta^{(t+1, 0)} = \mathbf{R}(\beta)\zeta^{(t,2)}
\end{equation}$$


## Look Ahead HMC
Although it does not use the Metropolis step, the algorithm sill requires the acceptance probabilities, to see whether or not it performs another Leapfrog integration step. This enables us to ensure acceptance ratios remain high. A bound on the number of additional steps maybe placed, such that if you perform too many and the required probability is still less than one, then we flip. Essentially the algorithm minimizes the number of times the momentum flip, $$\mathbf{F}\zeta$$ is performed. 

### Step 1 
Transition to a new state by applying the Leapfrog operator $$\mathbf{L}$$ between $$1$$ and $$K \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$$ times, or by applying the momentum flip operator.
$$\begin{equation}
\zeta^{(t,1)}
\begin{cases}
\mathbf{L}\zeta^{(t,0)} &\hspace{1cm} \text{with probability } \pi_{\mathbf{L}}^{1}(\zeta^{(t,0)})\\
\mathbf{L}^{2}\zeta^{(t,0)} &\hspace{1cm} \text{with probability } \pi_{\mathbf{L}}^{2}(\zeta^{(t,0)})\\
\ldots\\
\mathbf{L}^{K}\zeta^{(t,0)} &\hspace{1cm} \text{with probability } \pi_{\mathbf{L}}^{K}(\zeta^{(t,0)})\\
\mathbf{F}\zeta^{(t,0)} &\hspace{1cm} \text{with probability } \pi_{\mathbf{F}}^{1}(\zeta^{(t,0)})
\end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

### Step 2
Corrupt the momentum with noise

$$\begin{equation}
\zeta^{(t+1, 0)} = \mathbf{R}(\beta)\zeta^{(t,1)}
\end{equation}$$

## Transition Probabilities 

It should be first noted that the following trnasition probabilities do not actually satisfy detailed balance, but instead satisfy a condition, often used in Physics, called *generalized* detailed balance. This follows from the observation that:

$$\begin{equation} p(\zeta) \pi_{\mathbf{L}^{a}}(\zeta) = p(\mathbf{FL}^{a}\zeta) \pi_{\mathbf{L}^{a}}(\mathbf{FL}^{a}\zeta) \end{equation}$$

The evolution of a state $$\zeta$$ to state $$\mathbf{L}^{a}\zeta$$ is determined by the transition probabilities:

$$\begin{equation}
\pi_{L^{a}}(\zeta) = \min [1 - \sum_{b < a}\pi_{\mathbf{L}^{b}}(\zeta), \frac{p(\mathbf{FL}^{a}\zeta)}{p(\zeta)}(1 - \sum_{b < a}\pi_{\mathbf{L}^{b}}(\mathbf{FL}^{a}\zeta))]
\end{equation}$$

This greedily sets the transition probability to be as large as possible, under the restrictions that the total transion porbability out of state $$\zeta$$ not exceed 1 and that the transition rate in the forward direction ($$\zeta \leftarrow \mathbf{L}^{a}\zeta $$) not exceed exceed the transition rate in the reverse direction ($$ \mathbf{FL}^{a}\zeta \leftarrow \mathbf{F}\zeta) $$.

Any remaining unassigned probability is assigned to the momentum flip trnasition:
$$\begin{equation}
\pi_{\mathbf{F}}(\zeta)  = 1 - \sum_{a} \pi_{\mathbf{L}^{a}}(\zeta)
\end{equation}$$

See section 4.4 of the paper for a proof that these transition probabilities satisfy the *fixed point equation* .
